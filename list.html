            <dt>How can yoga help in overall development?</dt>
            <dd>Yoga is not about self-development; it is about self-dissolution. It is the method or the process which allows an individual piece of life to yoke itself to the cosmic. When your experience of life shifts from being a limited entity to universality, this is yoga. When there is a kind of oneness or wholeness within ourselves, this is yoga. Then you have a certain freedom to play with your life whichever way you want, but at the same time life cannot leave a scratch upon you.</dd>
       
            <dt>:The word “yoga” in Sanskrit means “union”. Is there some simple practice we can do to move towards the union?</dt>
            <dd>The simplest form of yoga, to bring this union is Namaskar. The first level of conflict that happens within you is between your ida and pingala, the masculine and the feminine, the sun and moon within, the yin and yang, right and left brain. There is a friction between these two polarities which finds expression in a million ways in your life. By putting your hands together, you can bring harmony to the dualities within and there is a possibility that you can also unite the world.</dd>
